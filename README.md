# Unsupervised-ML-project
Made on JUPYTER notebook and the programming language used is Python. This is a Unsupervised Machine Leaning Project. In an Unsupervised Machine Learning project we work on unlabeled dataset and take help of cluster analysis.
Cluster Analaysis is important as it determines the grouping among unlabeled datasets. 
In this project , I have taken the Iris dataset , in which i have created clusters between different species of the Iris flower. 
I have made use of python libraries like pandas , matplotloib , numpy and sklearn. In this project you will also find use of a new command 'KMeans'.
In the end you will find the scatter visualisation of the clusters for a better understanding.
I have made this project for submission of MILESTONE-1 under my mentorship program in Lean In Banasthali. Thank You.
